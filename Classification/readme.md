# Stock Price Prediction Using News Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices by analyzing the sentiment of financial news titles. It employs various machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis to understand the impact of news on stock market trends.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including normalization, one-hot encoding, and handling imbalanced datasets.
- Sentiment analysis of news titles using NLP techniques.
- Implementation of machine learning models like Decision Tree, KNN, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and Random Forest.
- Evaluation of models based on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
To install the required Python packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 
1.Place your data file (final_stocks.csv) in the project directory, or set an environment variable DATA_PATH to its path:
```bash
export DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/data.csv
```
2.Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```

You will see the table of the models and results.
